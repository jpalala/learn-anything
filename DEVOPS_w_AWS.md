### Step 3: Continuous Integration with AWS Tools

* Explore AWS CodeBuild and CodePipeline basics
* Set up simple CI pipelines: build, test, and feedback
* Integrate automated tests into your CI process

**Checkpoint:** Can you create and run a CI pipeline on AWS?

---

### Step 4: Continuous Delivery & Deployment on AWS

* Understand CD vs. Continuous Deployment
* Use AWS CodeDeploy and CodePipeline for automated deployments
* Learn deployment strategies (blue-green, canary)
* Explore AWS Elastic Beanstalk for app deployment

**Checkpoint:** Can you automate deployment pipelines and apply deployment strategies on AWS?

---

### Step 5: Containerization with Docker & AWS ECS/EKS

* Learn Docker fundamentals: containers, images, Dockerfiles
* Deploy containers using AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS)
* Introduction to Kubernetes on AWS with Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)

**Checkpoint:** Can you build Docker images and deploy containers on AWS ECS/EKS?

---

### Step 6: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with AWS

* Learn AWS CloudFormation basics for resource provisioning
* Explore Terraform for multi-cloud IaC (optional but recommended)
* Practice writing IaC scripts to create and update AWS infrastructure

**Checkpoint:** Can you provision and manage AWS resources with IaC tools?

---

### Step 7: Monitoring and Logging with AWS

* Use AWS CloudWatch for monitoring metrics, logs, and alerts
* Set up dashboards and alarms for your applications and infrastructure
* Explore AWS X-Ray for distributed tracing

**Checkpoint:** Can you monitor your AWS applications and respond to alerts?

---

### Step 8: Security & DevSecOps in AWS

* Understand AWS IAM for permissions and roles
* Integrate security scans into CI/CD (e.g., using Amazon Inspector)
* Manage secrets securely with AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store

**Checkpoint:** Can you implement basic security best practices in your AWS DevOps workflow?

---

### Step 9: Collaboration & Culture
