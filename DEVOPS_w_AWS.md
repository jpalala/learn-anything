# DevOps Learning Path (AWS Focus) ðŸš€

---

### Step 1: Understand DevOps Fundamentals

* Learn what DevOps is and why it matters
* Study Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD), and DevOps culture
* Understand the DevOps lifecycle and common tools

**Checkpoint:** Can you explain the goals of DevOps and basic concepts like CI/CD?

---

### Step 2: Master Git and Version Control

* Learn Git basics: commits, branches, merges, pull requests
* Use GitHub or AWS CodeCommit for repositories
* Practice common workflows like Gitflow or feature branching

**Checkpoint:** Can you confidently manage code versions and collaborate using Git?

---

### Step 3: Continuous Integration with AWS Tools

* Explore AWS CodeBuild and CodePipeline basics
* Set up simple CI pipelines: build, test, and feedback
* Integrate automated tests into your CI process

**Checkpoint:** Can you create and run a CI pipeline on AWS?

---

### Step 4: Continuous Delivery & Deployment on AWS

* Understand CD vs. Continuous Deployment
* Use AWS CodeDeploy and CodePipeline for automated deployments
* Learn deployment strategies (blue-green, canary)
* Explore AWS Elastic Beanstalk for app deployment

**Checkpoint:** Can you automate deployment pipelines and apply deployment strategies on AWS?

---

### Step 5: Containerization with Docker & AWS ECS/EKS

* Learn Docker fundamentals: containers, images, Dockerfiles
* Deploy containers using AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS)
* Introduction to Kubernetes on AWS with Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)

**Checkpoint:** Can you build Docker images and deploy containers on AWS ECS/EKS?

---

### Step 6: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with AWS

* Learn AWS CloudFormation basics for resource provisioning
* Explore Terraform for multi-cloud IaC (optional but recommended)
* Practice writing IaC scripts to create and update AWS infrastructure

**Checkpoint:** Can you provision and manage AWS resources with IaC tools?

---

### Step 7: Monitoring and Logging with AWS

* Use AWS CloudWatch for monitoring metrics, logs, and alerts
* Set up dashboards and alarms for your applications and infrastructure
* Explore AWS X-Ray for distributed tracing

**Checkpoint:** Can you monitor your AWS applications and respond to alerts?

---

### Step 8: Security & DevSecOps in AWS

* Understand AWS IAM for permissions and roles
* Integrate security scans into CI/CD (e.g., using Amazon Inspector)
* Manage secrets securely with AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store

**Checkpoint:** Can you implement basic security best practices in your AWS DevOps workflow?

---

### Step 9: Collaboration & Culture

* Practice clear communication in Agile/DevOps teams
* Use AWS tools for collaboration (e.g., AWS CodeCommit + Jira integrations)
* Participate actively in retrospectives and continuous improvement

**Checkpoint:** Are you collaborating effectively within your team and leveraging AWS tools?

Absolutely! Hereâ€™s a straightforward **practice project** focused on deploying a Dockerized web app using AWS services, which will help you apply many core DevOps and AWS concepts.

---

# Practice Project: Deploy a Dockerized Web Application on AWS ECS

---

### Project Overview

Youâ€™ll containerize a simple web application (can be a Node.js, Python Flask, or PHP app), push the Docker image to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR), and deploy it using AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) with Fargate (serverless containers). Youâ€™ll also set up a simple CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline to automate builds and deployments.

---

### What You Will Learn

* Docker basics: creating Dockerfiles and building images
* Using AWS ECR to store container images
* Deploying containers with AWS ECS and Fargate
* Setting up a basic CI/CD pipeline with AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild
* Managing infrastructure as code (optional: use AWS CloudFormation or Terraform)
* Monitoring deployment status and logs via AWS CloudWatch

---

### Step-by-Step Project Outline

1. **Create a simple web application**

   * Choose your favorite language/framework (Node.js/Express, Python/Flask, etc.)
   * Make sure it listens on a port and returns a basic response

2. **Containerize your app with Docker**

   * Write a Dockerfile for your app
   * Build and test the Docker image locally

3. **Push the Docker image to AWS ECR**

   * Create an ECR repository
   * Authenticate Docker with ECR
   * Push your image to the repository

4. **Create an ECS cluster and task definition**

   * Use AWS Management Console or CLI to set up ECS Cluster
   * Define your task with the ECR image and required CPU/memory

5. **Deploy the container on ECS with Fargate**

   * Create a Fargate service running your task
   * Assign a public IP to access the app

6. **(Optional) Set up AWS CodePipeline**

   * Connect your source repo (e.g., GitHub)
   * Configure CodeBuild to build the Docker image and push to ECR
   * Automate deployment to ECS

7. **Monitor and verify**

   * Use AWS CloudWatch to check logs and monitor the service
   * Access your running app via public URL

---

### Tips

* Start simple: just get the app running on ECS before adding the pipeline.
* Use AWS Free Tier resources to avoid costs.
* Refer to AWS official tutorials for step-by-step guidance (linked below).
