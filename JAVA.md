# How to learn JAVA

### üì£ A Note 

This syllabus is a structured guide to learning Java for backend development. While it provides a logical and comprehensive pathway, the key to mastery is hands-on practice, consistent effort, and a willingness to explore official documentation and community resources.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is a beginner to intermediate course syllabus for learning Java as a backend developer. This syllabus is structured to build a strong foundation in core Java before introducing the concepts and frameworks essential for backend development.

## CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) patterns

Thesis time: this syllabus builds on the previous one, integrating the new project into the curriculum.

***

### Thesis Project: Bank Networking App üè¶

The goal of this project is to build a simple bank account management system that separates read and write operations using the CQRS pattern.

* **Commands (Write side):** A command-line interface (CLI) to perform bank actions like `create account`, `deposit`, and `withdraw`. These commands will publish messages to a Kafka topic.
* **Queries (Read side):** A separate command-line application that acts as a "balance viewer." It will consume events from Kafka and update its own local, optimized data store (e.g., an in-memory database or a simple file) to provide quick access to account balances. This will demonstrate how read models can be a denormalized view of the data.
* **Kafka:** Serves as the intermediary message broker, ensuring that the command and query services are loosely coupled and can scale independently.

***

### Part 1: Core Java and Spring Fundamentals (Beginner)

This section remains the same as the initial syllabus to ensure a solid foundation.

* **Module 1: Introduction to Java and Basic Syntax**
    * Setup, variables, control flow, and arrays.
* **Module 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java**
    * Classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
* **Module 3: Advanced Core Java Topics**
    * Strings, exception handling, and the Collections Framework (`List`, `Set`, `Map`).

***

### Part 2: Backend Development with Spring and Kafka (Intermediate)

This is where the new project and CQRS topics are integrated.

#### Module 4: Introduction to the Spring Framework and Maven üõ†Ô∏è
* **Topic: Backend Basics:** What are REST APIs and how do they differ from our CLI app? Discuss client-server architecture.
* **Topic: Maven:** Project management and dependency injection.
* **Topic: Spring Core:** Introduce the IoC container and Dependency Injection. This is crucial for managing the components of our CQRS application.

#### Module 5: Introducing Apache Kafka ‚úâÔ∏è
* **Topic: What is Kafka?** Explain it as a distributed, event-streaming platform. Discuss key concepts: **topics**, **producers**, **consumers**, and **brokers**. Use an analogy of a post office where producers drop off letters (messages) to specific mailboxes (topics) and consumers pick them up.
* **Topic: Java with Kafka:** Learn to set up a basic **Kafka Producer** and **Kafka Consumer** in a Java application. Write a simple program to send and receive messages on a topic.
* **Topic: Serialization:** Discuss how to serialize Java objects into a format (like JSON or Avro) that can be sent over Kafka, and how to deserialize them on the other side.

#### Module 6: Implementing CQRS with Spring Boot and Kafka ‚öñÔ∏è

This module directly applies the CQRS pattern to the bank app project.

* **Topic: CQRS Explained:** Explain the Command Query Responsibility Segregation pattern. Highlight its benefits: **independent scaling** of read/write models, **optimized data schemas**, and **separation of concerns**. 
* **Topic: The Command Side (Write Model):**
    * Create the `CommandService` to handle bank actions (`createAccount`, `deposit`, `withdraw`).
    * These methods will **not** directly update a database. Instead, they will create **Command objects** (e.g., `DepositCommand`) and publish them to a Kafka "commands" topic.
    * Create a dedicated **Command Listener** that consumes from the "commands" topic and updates the authoritative data store (e.g., a simple file-based database or a more robust solution like H2).
* **Topic: The Query Side (Read Model):**
    * Create the `QueryService` to handle queries like `getBalance` or `listAllAccounts`.
    * This service will have its own separate, read-optimized data store (e.g., a `HashMap` or a simple text file).
    * Create an **Event Listener** that subscribes to an "events" topic on Kafka. This listener will consume events like `FundsDepositedEvent` or `AccountCreatedEvent` and update its read model. This shows how the read model is **eventually consistent**.
* **Topic: Event Sourcing:** Discuss how this architecture naturally leads to **Event Sourcing**, where a system's state is determined by a sequence of events. The events themselves become the source of truth.

***

### Part 3: Enhancing the Bank App (Intermediate)

This section adds more realistic backend development concepts.

#### Module 7: Integrating a Database üíæ
* **Topic: JPA and Spring Data JPA:** Introduce the Java Persistence API (JPA) and how **Spring Data JPA** simplifies database access.
* **Topic: The Command Store:** Use a real relational database (like H2 or MySQL) as the "write" database for the command side. Map Java classes to database tables using `@Entity`. This makes the write model authoritative.
* **Topic: The Query Store:** Discuss how to use a different data store for the read side. For example, a **NoSQL database** like MongoDB could be used to create denormalized views of the data, which are very efficient for reads.

#### Module 8: Spring MVC and REST APIs (as an alternative) üåê
* **Topic: Building a RESTful API:** Transition from a command-line interface to a web-based one.
* **Topic: `RestController`:** Use Spring's `@RestController` to expose the **QueryService** and **CommandService** over HTTP endpoints. This demonstrates how a frontend application could interact with the backend.
* **Topic: API vs. CLI:** Compare and contrast the two approaches, explaining why an API is more common for modern web applications.

#### Module 9: Testing and Deployment üì¶
* **Topic: Unit and Integration Testing:** Write tests for the command and query services using **JUnit** and **Mockito**.
* **Topic: Spring Boot Testing:** Use `@SpringBootTest` to write integration tests for the entire application, including the Kafka setup.
* **Topic: Deployment:** Briefly discuss how to package the application into a JAR file and deploy it. Touch on the concept of running a Kafka cluster and multiple instances of the command and query services to demonstrate scalability.
