### 🧠 Note

Laravel uses the **Active Record** pattern through Eloquent, in contrast to Symfony’s **Data Mapper** via Doctrine. This means model classes like `Product` inherit DB logic (like Java’s ActiveRecord-style ORMs), making development fast and intuitive, but often coupling business and persistence logic.
