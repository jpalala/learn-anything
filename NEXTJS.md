# NEXTJS

**Next.js** has become *the* go-to **full-stack framework for React**, so it deserves its own concise, modern syllabus.

Here’s a **generic, high-level Next.js syllabus** that fits your **“Learn Anything”** repo. It assumes you're already familiar with **React basics** (JSX, components, props/state).

## ⚡ Learn Anything — Next.js Essentials (Generic Syllabus)

### 🧭 Overview

**Next.js** is a React-based framework built by **Vercel** for building **server-rendered**, **static**, and **hybrid** web applications. It combines frontend + backend in one codebase.

---

### 📦 Module 1: Getting Started

* What is Next.js and why use it?
* Setup with `npx create-next-app`
* Folder structure: `/pages`, `/public`, `/components`, `/styles`

🔗 [Next.js Docs – Getting Started](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started)

---

### 🔄 Module 2: Routing & Navigation

* File-based routing (`/pages/index.tsx` → `/`)
* Dynamic routes: `[id].tsx`
* Nested routes and catch-all routes (`[...slug].tsx`)
* `<Link>` component for client-side navigation

🔗 [Docs – Routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction)

---

### 🔁 Module 3: Data Fetching (SSR/SSG)

* `getStaticProps()` for static generation
* `getServerSideProps()` for server-rendered pages
* `getStaticPaths()` for dynamic static pages
* `fetch()` vs internal API routes

🔗 [Docs – Data Fetching](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching)

### 📄 Module 4: API Routes

* Create backend functions in `/pages/api/`
* Useful for forms, DB access, or authentication
* Works like Express/Node handlers

* App Router (from Next.js 13+): server components, layouts, loading states
* Authentication (e.g., NextAuth.js)
* Working with databases (Prisma, MongoDB, etc.)

Would you like me to create a Markdown version for your repo? Or a “Next.js vs Laravel” or “Next.js vs traditional backend” comparison?
