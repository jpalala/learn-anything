## 📦 Learn Anything: Backend Frameworks — Symfony and Doctrine ORM (Intermediate)

Welcome to the **Doctrine and Symfony ORM module**, a key part of the *Advanced Web Backend* path. This section dives into how Symfony handles data persistence using **Doctrine**, how it contrasts with **Laravel’s Eloquent**, and how patterns like **DTOs** (Data Transfer Objects) apply across frameworks and languages, including Java.

---

### 🧭 Module 1: Understanding Symfony’s Architecture and Database Layer

Let’s start by looking under the hood of Symfony — a framework designed for maintainability, testability, and long-term scalability.

#### 🔍 Key Concepts

* **Symfony’s Core Principles**

  * Symfony is built around *decoupled*, reusable components.
  * Emphasizes **Dependency Injection**, **MVC**, and **flexible architecture**.
  * Suitable for **enterprise-grade** and **modular** applications.

* **Doctrine ORM: The Data Mapper Pattern**

  * Doctrine acts as Symfony’s default ORM.
  * Uses **Plain PHP Objects (POPOs)** as Entities — no base class inheritance.
  * Separation of concerns: Entities hold no DB logic; instead, persistence is handled via **Repositories** and the **EntityManager**.

#### ✅ Practical Skills

* Generate an entity using the Symfony CLI:

  ```bash
  php bin/console make:entity
  ```

* Define properties using PHP 8 attributes:

  ```php
  #[ORM\Column(length: 255)]
  private ?string $name = null;
  ```

* Run migrations:

  ```bash
  php bin/console make:migration
  php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
  ```

### 🛠 Module 2: Working with Doctrine Entities in Symfony

Here, we put Doctrine into action — creating, fetching, and saving entities through the **EntityManager** and **Repositories**.

#### 🔄 Repositories and the EntityManager

* Repositories are used to **fetch** entities.
* EntityManager is used to **persist**, **update**, and **remove** them.

#### ✍️ CRUD with Doctrine (Symfony)

```php
$product = new Product();
$product->setName('Ergonomic Mouse');
$product->setDescription('Wireless, rechargeable mouse');

$entityManager->persist($product);
$entityManager->flush();
```

To retrieve:

```php
$product = $productRepository->find($id);
```

If not found, throw a 404 response or return null — Symfony leaves this behavior to the developer.

### 🔄 Module 3: Doctrine vs Eloquent — What's the Difference?

Laravel’s Eloquent ORM and Symfony’s Doctrine ORM solve the same problem (object-relational mapping), but use **fundamentally different design philosophies**.

| Feature          | Doctrine (Symfony)          | Eloquent (Laravel)              |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Pattern          | Data Mapper                 | Active Record                   |
| Entity Logic     | No DB logic in entity class | DB logic built into model       |
| Flexibility      | High (decoupled)            | Moderate (convenient)           |
| Learning Curve   | Steeper                     | Simpler                         |
| Enterprise Usage | Preferred                   | Less common at enterprise scale |

#### 🧠 Analogy: Think Java

If you’ve worked with **Java**, Doctrine Entities feel like **Java DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)** — plain classes with fields and getters/setters. No persistence logic lives inside them.

Compare:

```java
// Java DTO
public class ProductDTO {
    private String name;
    private String description;

    // Getters and Setters
}
```

With:

```php
// Doctrine Entity
class Product {
    #[ORM\Column(length: 255)]
    private ?string $name = null;

    public function getName(): ?string {
        return $this->name;
    }

    public function setName(string $name): static {
        $this->name = $name;
        return $this;
    }
}
```

In both cases, logic is elsewhere — controllers, services, or repositories handle data flow, not the object itself.

---

### 💡 Module 4: Controller Integration — Hands-On Symfony + Doctrine

Here’s a real-world example: a Symfony controller that creates and retrieves `Product` entities using Doctrine.

#### Symfony Example

```php
#[Route('/product/{id}', name: 'app_product_show')]
public function show(ProductRepository $productRepository, int $id): Response
{
    $product = $productRepository->find($id);

    if (!$product) {
        throw $this->createNotFoundException('Product not found');
    }

    return $this->render('product/show.html.twig', ['product' => $product]);
}
```

To create a product:

```php
#[Route('/product/create', name: 'app_product_create')]
public function create(EntityManagerInterface $entityManager): Response
{
    $product = new Product();
    $product->setName('Standing Desk');
    $product->setDescription('Adjustable height desk');

    $entityManager->persist($product);
    $entityManager->flush();

    return new Response('Created product ID: ' . $product->getId());
}
```

---

### 🆚 Module 5: Laravel Comparison — Eloquent in Action

Laravel takes a different approach. Here, the model **inherits from** `Model`, gaining persistence methods directly.

#### Laravel Eloquent Model

```php
class Product extends Model
{
    use HasFactory;

    protected $fillable = ['name', 'description'];
}
```

#### Laravel Controller Example

```php
public function store(Request $request): RedirectResponse
{
    $product = Product::create([
        'name' => $request->input('name'),
        'description' => $request->input('description'),
    ]);

    return redirect('/products/' . $product->id);
}
```

Notice how **Eloquent combines data and behavior**, unlike Doctrine's clean separation.

## 🧠 Final Thoughts: When to Use What?

| Use Case                       | Recommendation           |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Rapid Prototyping or MVP       | Laravel + Eloquent       |
| Large-scale Enterprise Systems | Symfony + Doctrine       |
| Decoupled business logic       | Doctrine / Data Mapper   |
| Simplicity & Speed             | Eloquent / Active Record |

Both are valid, modern ORMs — your choice depends on project size, architecture goals, and team familiarity.

---

## 🧩 Key Takeaways

* Doctrine encourages separation of concerns: like Java DTOs, entities are just data holders.
* Symfony emphasizes flexibility and long-term scalability.
* Laravel offers simplicity and rapid development with expressive syntax.
* Knowing both paradigms (Active Record vs Data Mapper) helps you adapt to many modern frameworks.
