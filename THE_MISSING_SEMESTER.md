This here is a **high-level syllabus** inspired by MIT’s **"The Missing Semester of Your CS Education"**, focusing on the essential tools and practices that empower web developers.

This version is concise—no deep dives—but includes links for further exploration.

## Learn Anything: Tooling Essentials for Web Developers

### Module A: Shell & Productivity Tools

* **The Shell & Command Line**

  * Core shell usage: navigation, file operations, scripting, piping, shell variables—essential for efficiency and automation.
* **Productivity Enhancements**

  * Terminal multiplexers like `tmux`
  * Shell scripting, creating aliases, customizing your prompt, and using dotfiles for portability and consistency.
    ([GitHub][1], [DEV Community][2])

### Module B: Powerful Editors

* **Mastering Vim (or another CLI editor)**

  * Learn navigation, editing, search/replace, split windows.
  * Customize with plugins like `ctrlp`, `nerdtree`, `easymotion` via `.vimrc`.
    ([Felix Yammers On...][3], [courses.dwf.dev][4])

### Module C: Data Wrangling & Text Processing

* **Command-Line Text Tools**

  * Use `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, `sort`, `head`, `tail`, `paste`, and `bc` to process and analyze text efficiently.
    ([GitHub][1], [yorkofyou.github.io][5])

### Module D: Version Control with Git

* **Git Fundamentals**

  * Branching, merges, conflict resolution, commit best practices, and PR workflows.
* **Advanced Git**

  * Delve into Git’s branching model, rebasing, rewriting history, and the internal object model.
    ([Reddit][6], [DEV Community][2], [Micah Kepe][7])

### Module E: Debugging & Profiling

* **Debug Techniques**

  * Learn logging versus print debugging, use of `pdb`, `gdb`, and system logs (`journalctl`, `logger`).
* **Performance Profiling**

  * Use tools like `cProfile`, `kernprof`, visual flamegraphs, sampling vs tracing, and system resource monitors (`htop`, `iotop`, `lsof`, `ss`).
    ([Medium][8], [Daniel Diamond][9], [DEV Community][2])

### Module F: Build Tools & Dependency Management

* **Automating Builds**

  * Understand `make`, dependency graphs, and build rules.
* **Managing Dependencies**

  * Use system and language-specific package managers—`apt`, `pip`, `PyPI`, `RubyGems`, etc.
    ([Daniel Diamond][9], [DEV Community][2])

### Module G: Security & Cryptography Basics

* **Foundational Security Concepts**

  * Hash functions (e.g., SHA-1, SHA‑256), key derivation (PBKDF2), symmetric encryption, entropy, and secure password storage.
* **Practical Security Measures**

  * Use PGP for file encryption, veracrypt for volumes, and enable 2FA for critical accounts.
    ([DEV Community][2], [courses.dwf.dev][4])

### Module H: Web & Browsers

* **Browser Mastery**

  * Learn key shortcuts, search operators (e.g., `"exact phrase"`, `site:`, `filetype:`).
* **Customization**

  * Use extensions like **uBlock Origin**, **Stylus**, and **Tampermonkey** for CSS/JS overrides, theming, or behavior tweaks.
* **API Usage & Automation**

  * Interact with web APIs via `curl` and `jq`, or automate with Selenium/WebDriver tools.
